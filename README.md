# Whole_Exome_Sequencing_Workflow_for_multiple_samples_PHINDaccess

Hello!!

This is our newly developed pipeline for the simultaneaous analysis of multiple human whole exome sequences generated by an Illumina platform.

This pipeline was developed as a result of our work during the hackathon: Study of genetic susceptibility to COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 human host-pathogen interactions, organized in the frame of Phindaccess project (https://phindaccess.org/)

For now, the pipeline is suitable for the analysis of up to 30 whole exome sequences.

Team members: Hamza Dallali, Yosr Hamdi, Afef Rais, Imen Moumni, Manel Gharbi.
